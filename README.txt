About BCOE&M
***********************************************************************************
Brew Competition Online Entry & Management is an online  application to assist 
homebrew competition hosts (of the beer, cider, mead variety) to collect, store,
and manage their competition entry and scoring data.

The biggest challenges of organizing a homebrewing competition is knowing who has 
entered what and how many, organizing judging efficiently, and reporting the 
results of the competition in a timely manner. BCOE&M provides a single online 
interface to collect entry and participant data, organize judging tables and 
assignments, input scoring data, and report the results.

BCOE&M is free and open-source.
