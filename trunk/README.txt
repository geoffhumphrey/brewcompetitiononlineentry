About

**********************************************************************

The Brew Competition Online Entry and Management (BCOE&M) system is an online application to assist homebrew competition hosts (of the beer variety) to collect, store, and manage their competition entry and scoring data.

The biggest challenges of organizing a homebrewing competition is knowing who has entered what and how many, organizing judging efficiently, and reporting the results of the competition in a timely manner. BCOE&M provides a single online interface to collect entry and participant data, organize judging tables and assignments, collect scores, and report the results.

BCOE&M is free and open-source.
