Sometimes wood aging is intended to impart the particularly unique character of the wood, but wood-aged is not necessarily synonymous with imparting wood-flavors. Wood character can be characterized as a complex blend of vanillin and unique wood character. Wood-derived character can also be characterized by flavors of the product that was in the barrel during prior use. These wood-derived flavors, if present in this style, can be very low in character and barely perceived or evident or assertive as wood-derived flavors. Any degree of woodderived flavors should be in balance with other beer character. Fruit and herb/spiced versions may take on the hue, flavors and aromas of added ingredients. Usually bacteria and "wild" yeasts fermentation contributes complex esters and results in a dry to very dry beer. Ultimately a balance of flavor, aroma and mouthfeel are sought with the marriage of acidity, complex esters, and new beer with wood and/or barrel flavors. Beers in this style may or may not have Brettanomyces character. Brewers when entering this category should specify type of barrel used and any other special treatment or ingredients used. Competition managers may create style subcategories to differentiate between high alcohol and low alcohol beers and very dark and lighter colored beer as well as for fruit beers and non-fruit beers. Competitions may develop guidelines requesting brewers to specify what kind of wood (new or used oak, other wood varieties). The brewer may be asked to explain the special nature (wood used, base beer style(s) and achieved character) of the beer.','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/resources/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/resources/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleActive' => 'N','brewStyleOwn' => 'bcoe','brewStyleReqSpec' => '1','brewStyleStrength' => '0','brewStyleCarb' => '0','brewStyleSweet' => '0','brewStyleTags' => '2015','brewStyleComEx' => NULL,'brewStyleEntry' => NULL),

Overall, Baltic Porters have a very smooth lagered character with distinctive caramelized sugars, licorice and chocolate-like character of roasted malts and dark sugars. Roasted dark malts should not contribute bitterness, or astringent roast character. A low degree of smokiness from malt may be evident. Debitterized roast malts are best used for this style. Because of its alcoholic strength, aroma may include gentle (low) lager fruitiness (berries, grapes, plums, not banana; ale-like fruitiness from warm temperature fermentation is not appropriate), complex alcohols, cocoa-like, roast malt (and sometimes coffee-like roast barley, yet not bitter). Hop aroma is very low, though a hint of floral or sweet hop aroma can complement aromatics and flavor without dominance. Baltic Porters are not hop bitter dominated and expressed as low to medium-low. Baltic porters range from having medium to full body complemented with a medium-low to medium level of malty sweetness. No butterscotch-like diacetyl or sweet corn-like dimethylsulfide (DMS) should be apparent in aroma or flavor.','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/resources/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/resources/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleActive' => 'N','brewStyleOwn' => 'bcoe','brewStyleReqSpec' => '0','brewStyleStrength' => '0','brewStyleCarb' => '0','brewStyleSweet' => '0','brewStyleTags' => '2015','brewStyleComEx' => NULL,'brewStyleEntry' => NULL),

The term "juicy" is frequently used to describe taste and aroma attributes often present in these beers which result from late, often very large, additions of hops. A juicy character is not required, however. Other hopderived attributes such as citrus, pine, spice, floral or others may be present with or without the presence of juicy attributes.','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleActive' => 'N','brewStyleOwn' => 'bcoe','brewStyleReqSpec' => '0','brewStyleStrength' => '0','brewStyleCarb' => '0','brewStyleSweet' => '0','brewStyleTags' => '','brewStyleComEx' => '','brewStyleEntry' => NULL),

Versions of this beer style made outside of the Brussels area are said to be "BelgianStyle Gueuze Lambics." The Belgian-style versions are made to resemble many of the beers of true origin. While Traditional Gueuze Lambics are dry, Contemporary Gueuze Lambics may have a degree of sweetness contributed by sugars or other sweeteners. Traditionally, Gueuze is brewed with unmalted wheat, malted barley, and stale, aged hops. Whereas Contemporary Gueuze Lambics may incorporate specialty malts that influence the hue, flavor and aroma of the finished beer.','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleLink' => 'https://www.brewersassociation.org/edu/brewers-association-beer-style-guidelines/','brewStyleActive' => 'N','brewStyleOwn' => 'bcoe','brewStyleReqSpec' => '0','brewStyleStrength' => '0','brewStyleCarb' => '0','brewStyleSweet' => '0','brewStyleTags' => '','brewStyleComEx' => '','brewStyleEntry' => NULL),
