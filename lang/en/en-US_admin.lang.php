To translate this file, first make a copy of it and rename it with the language name in the title.

==============================

Use ISO 169-2 Standards for and WWW3C Language Tag Standards for naming of language files. Use the
ALPHA-2 letter code whenever possible.

ISO 169-2:
https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

WWW3 Language Tags:
https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/

WWW3 Choosing a Language Tag:
https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags

According to the WWW3:

"Always bear in mind that the golden rule is to keep your language tag as short as possible. Only
add further subtags to your language tag *if they are needed to distinguish the language from
something else in the context where your content is used...*

"Unless you specifically need to highlight that you are talking about Italian as spoken in Italy
you should use it for Italian, and not it-IT. The same goes for any other possible combination."

To determine a subtag, go to the IANA Language Subtag Registry:
http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry

==============================

Items that need translation into other languages are housed here in PHP variables - each start with
a dollar sign ($). The words, phrases, etc. (called strings) that need to be translated are housed
between double-quotes ("). Please, ONLY alter the text between the double quotes!

For example, a translated PHP variable would look like this:

English (US) before translation:
$label_volunteer_info = "Volunteer Info";

Spanish translated:
$label_volunteer_info = "Información de Voluntarios";

Portuguese translated:
$label_volunteer_info = "Informações Voluntário";

==============================

Please note: the strings that need to be translated MAY contain HTML code. Please leave this code
intact! For example:

English (US):
$beerxml_text_008 = "Browse for your BeerXML compliant file on your hard drive and click <em>Upload</em>.";

Spanish:
$beerxml_text_008 = "Buscar su archivo compatible BeerXML en su disco duro y haga clic en <em>Cargar</em>.";

Note that the <em>...</em> tags were not altered. Just the word "Upload" to "Cargar" betewen those tags.
