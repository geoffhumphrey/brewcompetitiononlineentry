To translate this file, first make a copy of it and rename it with the language name in the title.

==============================

Use ISO 169-2 Standards for and WWW3C Language Tag Standards for naming of language files. Use the
ALPHA-2 letter code whenever possible.

ISO 169-2:
https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php

WWW3 Language Tags:
https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/

WWW3 Choosing a Language Tag:
https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-choosing-language-tags

To determine a subtag, go to the IANA Language Subtag Registry:
http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry

According to the WWW3:

"Always bear in mind that the golden rule is to keep your language tag as short as possible. Only
add further subtags to your language tag *if they are needed to distinguish the language from
something else in the context where your content is used..."

"Unless you specifically need to highlight that you are talking about Italian as spoken in Italy
you should use it 'for Italian, and not it-IT. The same goes for any other possible combination."

"You should only use a region subtag if it contributes information needed in a particular context
to distinguish this language tag from another one; otherwise leave it out."

================ FORMAT =================

Always indicate the primary language subtag first, then a dash (-) and then the region subtag. The
region subtag is in all capital letters or a three digit number.

Examples:
en-US
English spoken in the United States
en is the PRIMARY language subtag
US is the REGION subtag (note the capitalization)

es-ES
Spanish spoken in Spain

es-419
Spanish spoken in Latin America

========================================

Items that need translation into other languages are housed here in PHP variables - each start with
a dollar sign ($). The words, phrases, etc. (called strings) that need to be translated are housed
between double-quotes ("). Please, ONLY alter the text between the double quotes!

For example, a translated PHP variable would look like this (encoding is utf8mb4; therefore, accented and other special characters are acceptable):

English (US) before translation:
$label_volunteer_info = "Volunteer Info";

Spanish translated:
$label_volunteer_info = "Información de Voluntarios";

Portuguese translated:
$label_volunteer_info = "Informações Voluntário";

========================================

Please note: the strings that need to be translated MAY contain HTML code. Please leave this code intact! For example:

English (US):
$beerxml_text_008 = "Browse for your BeerXML compliant file on your hard drive and click <em>Upload</em>.";

Spanish:
$beerxml_text_008 = "Buscar su archivo compatible BeerXML en su disco duro y haga clic en <em>Cargar</em>.";

Note that the <em>...</em> tags were not altered. Just the word "Upload" to "Cargar" between those tags.
